                                <p>Two years ago, Elon Musk published a paper proposing the concept of the Hyperloop as a means to further accelerating the advent of sustainable transport. The Hyperloop is a pod-transport system powered by linear induction motors in a near-vaccum tube. Musk envisions the Hyperloop being an alternative to high-speed train travel, as it is capable of reaching speeds of 760 mph while remaining more efficient from both a cost and energy perspective than any other current modes of transport. 

                                </br></br>
                                
                                Currently juggling concurrent leadership roles at SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity, Musk is looking to todayâ€™s youth to catalyze the development of this technology. As such, SpaceX is hosting an annual student competition in which qualified entrants can design and build a sub-scaled pod. Students at Cornell University have come together to form Cornell Hyperloop: an interdisciplinary team working to develop the optimal Hyperloop pod design. 

                                </br></br>

                                In January, we will present our final design to SpaceX, by June we will finish constructing the our pod prototype, and this Summer we will be one of the few to test the Hyperloop.</p>

                                </br>

                                <h2>Get Involved</h2>
                                <p>Cornell Hyperloop is seeking corporate and brand partnerships as it launches into the next steps of bringing the Hyperloop concept to life. Partnering with Cornell Hyperloop has many benefits, based on your level of sponsorship:
                                </p>
                                   
                                </br>
                                
                                <h2>Tier Four ($1-$1000)</h2>
                                <p>Tier Four donors will be listed on our website. Donors above $50 are also entitled to a 10 minute skype call with two Cornell Hyperloop team members to learn more about Hyperloop and the team.</p>
                      
                                </br>
                                
                                <h2>Tier Three ($1,000-$10,000)</h2>
                                <p>Tier Three donors will be listed on our website along with a sponsorship message and their logo. The logo will also be included on the Cornell Hyperloop pod in tertiary size (1 sq ft or larger space permitting). All other Cornell Hyperloop peripherals (t-shirts, notebooks, etc.) will also include the logo. Corporate tier three donors will also receive all Cornell Hyperloop team members' resumes.
                                </p>
                                

                                </br>
                                
                                <h2>Tier Two ($10,000-$20,000)</h2>
                                <p>Tier Two donors will receive the same rewards as Tier three, with the logo in secondary size (4 sq ft or larger space permitting). Tier two donors will also receive a laser engraved plaque signed by all the Cornell Hyperloop team members at competition weekend, and a high quality press kit of video and still material from competition weekend.</p>
                      
                                </br>
                                
                                <h2>Tier One ($20,000 and above)</h2>
                                <p>Tier One donors will receive the same rewards as tier three, with the logo in primary size (12 sq ft or larger space permitting). In addition, Cornell Hyperloop will work with each tier one donor to write and release a post highlighting their incredible support in the weeks leading up to Design and Competition Weekend. Additional benefits for donors above tier one can be negotiated on a case by case basis.</p>
                                
                                </br>
                                
                                <h2>Gifts-In-Kind</h2>
                                <p>Gifts-In-Kind will be counted at a monetary value agreed upon before receipt and applied to the tiers above. Short timelines and critical components of the Cornell Hyperloop build may lead to an agreed monetary value higher than the actual cost to the donor.</p>
