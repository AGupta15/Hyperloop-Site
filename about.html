                                <p>Cornell Hyperloopâ€™s mission is to contribute to the development of Hyperloop and the future of transportation by designing and building a pod for the SpaceX Hyperloop competition.</p>

                                <p>After the 2016 Hyperloop competition, the Cornell students of Openloop (A Hyperloop team comprised of multiple universities) decided to more efficiently contribute to Hyperloop by creating their own team using the talents and resources within Cornell University.</p>


                                <p>This year we will be taking part in the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition II 2017. Our mission is to be to able to build an up to scale Hyperloop Pod prototype. Last year, Cornell Hyperloop was part of a conglomerate team (Openloop), but we are splitting of to create a strictly Cornell Team. After making it past the first round with Openloop, this year we aim to go above and beyond what our predecessors were able to accomplish. We are starting from scratch to develop a faster and lighter pod that will outdo our competitors. With your support, our goal is simply within reach.
                                </p>
                                 
                                <p>Our current team is divided into multiple sub-teams to most efficiently allocate the specialized skills and interests of each member:</p>

                                </br>

                                <h2>MagLev</h2>
                                <p>Our Magnetic Levitation System will consist of Halbach Arrays, which will repel the pod from the I-Beam causing it to be raised off the ground. These Halbach Arrays give us the opportunity to also use MagLev as our main braking system.</p>

                                </br>

                                <h2>Fuselage</h2>
                                <p>The Cornell Hyperloop pod uses an unpressurized outer shell to negate the effects of full frontal air pressure and other debilitating forces at high speeds and acceleration.</br>

                                Our aerodynamic shell consists of less than 30kg of carbon fiber composites, adding to the efficiency of our design. Our lean frame enables us to achieve higher travel velocities while successfully minimizing drag and guaranteeing passenger safety.</p>

                                </br>

                                <h2>Suspension</h2>
                                <p>Our suspension and brakes system is fitted on a carbon fiber chassis that will be directly attached the outer fuselage surface. The braking setup will primarily be using our MagLev system, but will have a secondary system consisting of a set of brake pads on the I-Beam as well as a third using drag braking system.</p>
                                </br>

                                <h2>Electrical</h2>
                                <p>We're developing an electrical system to enable our pod to dynamically react and respond to information about its position and orientation. Our design relies on an in-house intelligent system to translate sensor inputs into corresponding actuator movement, allowing for all six degrees of freedom to be actively controlled.</p>

                                </br>

                                <h2>Business</h2>
                                <p>The Business team is the outward facing arm of Cornell Hyperloop. Our main objective is to connect with sponsors for donations and materials. We also focus heavily on our design, including our website, logos, and overall branding.</p>
